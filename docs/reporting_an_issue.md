# Reporting An Issue

If you find a data quality issue, issue with the documentation, or a bug in any
of the pipeline code, please report it to us!  You can do so by either:

1. Filing a github issue [here](https://github.com/Yale-Medicaid/TMSIS_data_documentation) for issues with documentation, or [here](https://github.com/Yale-Medicaid/TMSIS_ingestion) for issues with the ingested data or pipeline.
2. Emailing us at [beniamino.green[at]tuta.com](mailto:beniamino.green@tuta.com) or [anthony.lollo[at]yale.edu](mailto:anthony.lollo@yale.edu)

GitHub issues are preferred as they allow everyone to respond to and learn from
the issue, but email works if you don't have a GitHub account.
